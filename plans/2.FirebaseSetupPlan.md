# Firebase Setup Plan for YouTube Translator

This document outlines the Firebase architecture for the YouTube Video Translation Service, based on the initial high-level plan and our setup conversation.

## 1. Firebase Project

*   **Project ID:** `youtube-grandma-translator`
*   **Project Name:** Youtube Video Translator

## 2. Firebase Services Architecture

The following Firebase services will be used:

*   **Firestore:** Real-time database for job tracking and video metadata
*   **Cloud Functions:** Serverless backend for video processing pipeline
*   **Firebase Hosting:** Static hosting for React web application (SPA)
*   **Cloud Storage:** Media file storage for videos and audio at various processing stages
*   **Firebase Authentication:** (Future enhancement, not MVP)

## 3. Firestore Data Model (TBD - Specific Implementation)

Firestore will manage translation job state and metadata.

*   **Primary Collections:**
    *   **`jobs`**: Documents representing video translation requests
        *   **Fields:** TBD - Will include job status, progress tracking, URLs, timestamps, error handling
        *   **Status Flow:** TBD - Likely progression through queued → processing stages → completed/error
    *   **`videos`**: Optional collection for completed video metadata
        *   **Fields:** TBD - Will include references to storage locations, original video info, completion data

*   **Security Rules:**
    *   Currently: Test Mode (permissive)
    *   **Action Item:** Implement proper security rules before production
*   **Indexes:** TBD based on query patterns
*   **Configuration Files:** `firestore.rules`, `firestore.indexes.json`

## 4. Cloud Functions (Video Processing Backend)

*   **Language:** JavaScript
*   **Directory:** `functions/`
*   **Dependencies:** TBD - Will include:
    *   Firebase SDKs (admin, functions)
    *   YouTube downloading capability
    *   Audio transcription service integration
    *   Translation service integration  
    *   Text-to-speech service integration
    *   Video/audio processing tools

*   **Function Architecture (Conceptual):**
    *   **HTTP Trigger:** Accept job submissions from frontend
    *   **Firestore Trigger:** Process jobs when queued
    *   **Processing Pipeline Functions:** TBD - Will handle each step of:
        1. Video download
        2. Audio extraction
        3. Transcription
        4. Translation
        5. Speech synthesis
        6. Video/audio combination
        7. Job completion/error handling

*   **Error Handling:** Robust error management with Firestore status updates
*   **Environment Configuration:** API keys via Firebase Functions config
*   **ESLint:** Configured for code quality

## 5. Firebase Hosting (Web Application)

*   **Configuration:** Single Page App (SPA) with URL rewrites to `/index.html`
*   **Public Directory:** `public/`
*   **Planned Routes (React Router):**
    *   `/`: Input interface for YouTube link submission
    *   `/watch/:videoId`: Playback interface for translated videos
    *   Additional status/tracking routes TBD

*   **GitHub Actions:** Not configured initially (future enhancement)
*   **Configuration Files:** `firebase.json`, `public/index.html`

## 6. Cloud Storage (File Management)

*   **Security Rules File:** `storage.rules` (currently permissive)
*   **Storage Structure:** TBD - Will organize files by processing stage:
    *   Original downloaded content
    *   Intermediate processing files (audio extraction, etc.)
    *   Final translated videos for playback
    *   Temporary files with cleanup strategy

*   **Access Patterns:** TBD - Public read for final videos, function-only access for processing

## 7. Development Environment

*   **Node.js Version:** v22.14.0 (required for Firebase CLI compatibility)
*   **Firebase CLI:** Used for local development and deployment
    *   Local emulation: `firebase emulators:start`
    *   Deployment: `firebase deploy`
*   **Environment Variables:** Secure API key management via Firebase Functions configuration

## Next Steps & Action Items

1. **Frontend Development:** Set up React application structure
2. **Data Model Refinement:** Define specific Firestore schema based on processing requirements
3. **Cloud Functions Implementation:** Build out video processing pipeline
4. **Security Rules:** Implement proper Firestore and Storage security
5. **Service Integration:** Integrate with transcription, translation, and TTS services
6. **Testing Strategy:** Set up local development and testing workflow

This plan provides the architectural foundation while leaving implementation details flexible for iterative development.
