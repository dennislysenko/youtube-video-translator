# Russian Video Voiceover — Hosted Evaluation Plan (No Self-Hosting)

## Goals

**P1: Easiest setup & evaluation, high quality overall**  
**P2: Russian voice closely matches original English speaker**  
**P3: Final audio duration matches original (sync-friendly)**

---

## Hosted Stacks to Evaluate

### 1. Replicate (all stages)

**Models:**
- ASR: `openai/whisper` (Large-v3)  
- MT: `tomasmcm/alma-7b`  
- TTS: `lucataco/xtts-v2` (voice cloning)

**How to evaluate:**
- All models have “Playground” UIs (drop in files, hit **Run**)  
- No login needed for small tests  
- XTTS has `length_scale` to match duration

**Pros:**
- Fastest to try
- XTTS voice cloning across languages
- Fine control over timing

---

### 2. Hugging Face Inference API

**Models:**
- ASR: `openai/whisper-large-v3`  
- MT: `facebook/wmt19-en-ru`  
- TTS: `coqui/XTTS-v2` (voice cloning)

**How to evaluate:**
- Click "Try it out" on model pages  
- Need HF token (free tier usable)  
- XTTS available via demo Space

**Pros:**
- All models hosted; easy Python `transformers`/`huggingface_hub` usage  
- Same XTTS quality as Replicate  
- Pay-per-second, good for prototyping

---

### 3. Hybrid (Replicate + Hugging Face)

**Combo:**
- ASR: Replicate Whisper  
- MT: HF WMT19 (higher BLEU than ALMA)  
- TTS: Replicate XTTS-v2

**Why use it:**
- Best balance of speed, quality, and voice matching  
- Avoids ALMA hallucinations for news-style content  
- Tiny glue code needed

---

## Evaluation Checklist (≈10 minutes)

1. **Collect assets**
   - Short English video (≤30s, MP4)
   - Clean speaker sample (6–10s, WAV/MP3)

2. **ASR (Replicate Whisper)**
   - Run in Playground
   - Confirm transcription accuracy

3. **Machine Translation**
   - Paste 2–3 sentences into ALMA and/or WMT19
   - Compare tone and fidelity of Russian

4. **Voice Cloning (XTTS)**
   - Input RU text + speaker sample
   - Check for timbre, prosody, naturalness

5. **Timing Match**
   - Compare durations (`sox --i -D`)
   - Adjust XTTS `length_scale` if needed

6. **Pipeline Test**
   - Combine outputs with FFmpeg:
     ```bash
     ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -i ru.wav \
            -filter_complex "[1:a]aresample,atempo=1.01[a]" \
            -map 0:v -map "[a]" -c:v copy -c:a aac out_ru.mp4
     ```

## Next Steps

- Pick stack that sounds best and is easiest to automate  
- Add API call wrappers (Python/JS/etc)  
- Track per-minute cost vs throughput
